🐼 Pandas 101 — Beginner to Intermediate Tutorial
This guide will walk you through the essentials of using Pandas, the most popular data analysis library in Python — and take it a step further with more powerful filtering and CRUD-style operations.

📦 What Is Pandas?
Pandas is an open-source Python library designed for data manipulation and analysis. It makes working with structured data fast, flexible, and intuitive — especially if you're dealing with CSV files, Excel sheets, SQL tables, JSON, or APIs.

The two core data structures in Pandas are:

Series: A 1D labeled array (like a column)
DataFrame: A 2D labeled data structure (like a full spreadsheet or SQL table)
📊 What Is a DataFrame?
A DataFrame is a two-dimensional, tabular data structure with labeled rows and columns. Think of it as a Python-native spreadsheet — but way more powerful and programmable.

✅ Key Features:
Label-based indexing
Column-wise and row-wise operations
Support for mixed data types
Fast, vectorized operations (built on NumPy)
